## 🚀 Overview

Chemical is an innovative, performant, type-safe, and user-friendly programming language with a low memory footprint. It comes with first-class tooling out of the box, all customizable by developers.

---

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Chemical is in pre-alpha state, expect breaking changes and do not use in production.

## 💻 Syntax

Resembles Go, TypeScript, and C++, with powerful extensions:

```chemical
// Semicolons are optional
// Supports structs, interfaces, implementations, lambdas, switch, pointers

var x: int = 5

for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  var arr: int[5]    // uninitialized array of 5 ints
  if (i == 3) x += 2
  if (i == 6) break
  x++
}

func add(a: int, b: int): int {
  return a + b
}
```

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Download & Extract the latest ZIP from the [Releases](https://github.com/chemicallang/chemical/releases) page.
2. Inside the folder, run `./chemical configure` or `./chemical.exe configure`
3. Verify by running `chemical -v`

## 📚 Language Features

These features should give you an idea about features we have worked on

- C-like syntax with structs & namespaces
- Arrays, enums, unions
- Native lambdas (with capture)
- Macros & annotations
- Implicit & explicit casting
- Extension functions (like Kotlin)
- Raw pointers & memory control
- Full constructors & destructors
- Explicit copying (`.copy()` required)
- Comptime support & generics
- Overloading, variants, type aliases
- Trait & impl (Rust-like)
- Name mangling & conflict detection

## 🛠️ Build (From Source)

### Requirements

- 8–16 GB RAM
- C++ toolchain (for LSP)
- LLVM (for compiler)
- CLion or other IDE

### Building Tiny CC Based Compiler Project (easy, fast)

1. Clone this repo
2. Inside the repo, run `./scripts/configure.sh` (on windows, git bash must be installed)
3. Open the repo in IDE (in CLion, you'll get automatic build configurations) or build using cmake

LSP also depends on Tiny CC Based Compiler Project and is built similarly

### Building LLVM Based Compiler Project (takes time)

1. Clone `chemical-bootstrap` repo in this organization (contains LLVM/CLANG)
2. Run build scripts (`./build.bat` / `./build`) (this builds LLVM)
3. Inside it, clone this repo
4. Open this repo directory in terminal
5. Run the configure script using `./scripts/configure.sh` (on windows, bash must be installed, usually comes with git)
6. Open the repo in CLion

#### LSP

1. For LSP: clone `chemical-vscode`.
2. There's a run configuration for compiling and launching extension
3. Build and Launch the LSP server before launching the extension, The extension detects running lsp executable at port automatically

*Open an issue for any build errors.*

# 🎯 Vision & Design Goals

## Compiler plugins and language extensions — Scalability

Chemical exists to let you embed complex, domain-specific syntax into the language via compiler plugins. Extensions are first-class: add new syntax and behaviors without touching the core. Tooling (syntax highlighting, editor parsing) must continue to work for extended syntax. Scalability and extensibility are part of Chemical’s DNA.

## Comprehensive features

Real projects frequently need features a language didn’t originally include. Chemical aims to provide the capabilities you actually need while avoiding “syntax pollution.” Powerful, composable abstractions for library authors and power users come with sensible defaults and a gentle learning curve for beginners. The goal: lots of capability, minimal surprise.

## Memory safety — without the cost of simplicity

Long-term, Chemical will promote memory safety while keeping the language simple to use. Safety is a priority but not yet fully enforced — the initial focus is on core functionality and tooling. Once the core is stable, compiler-enforced safety checks will be added progressively; the beta compiler will enforce baseline safety guarantees.
