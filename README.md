## Chemical Programming Language

Chemical Programming Language brings language tooling & is customisable by the end developer or a user and not a library author.
It focuses on reusing and adding more to what's already built.
It allows you to rethink how programming languages mix and share concepts to create solutions that are tailored to syntax preferred by the project you are working on !

Here are the features we are aiming for.

### Usage Features

- Innovative
- Performant
- Ease of use
- Low memory footprint
- Everything Included Kit

### Developer Features

These features are sorted by priority, the features on top are what we will work to provide.

- Use as a template engine

- Use as an embedder language
- Use as a scripting language

### Contibuting

Chemical Programming Language is an open source work, It also allows you to completely customize it.
It requires a lot of contributions to support the large number of features that need to be supported, 
so we not just welcome contributions but encourage everybody to contribute. So we can bring our vision to life.
